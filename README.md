I added it in so that you can make changes, we can review, and merge later on. but this way your branch wont directly interfere with the origin.

Once you have cloned the repo, you can go to Repository > Open in Visual Studio Code
You can also use a hotkey "Ctrl + Shift + A"

## You may need to install Crestron Extensions to modify code
Crestron S+ (sentry07.crestron-splus)
Crestron Simpl+ (mwgustin.crestron-simpl-plus)
Crestron Simpl+ Code Snippets (mwgustin.crestron-simpl-plus-snippets)

You can search for these extensions in VSC. I don't tend to compile in VSC, I just compile in Crestron Simple +. 

## Push to Repo
When you make a change, you will see GitHub Desktop show that there is a change to the origin of your branch.

You can then commit the repo to the branch, then select Push Origin to create the Pull Request. Then we can see it together and compare.
